          Real estate is an incredibly personal experience — and for most
          people, it’s the biggest transaction they’ll ever make.

          PropertyBuy is built on a deep understanding of movers’ needs and a
          motivation to help you accomplish your moving goals. When you request
          to connect with an agent, PropertyBuy works to understand your unique
          situation in order to connect you with a local real estate
          professional who can tailor their services to you, help you explore
          options, and be your advocate to win your next home. That’s also why
          PropertyBuy provides a suite of products and services that helps most
          agents across the country do business more efficiently. This means
          agents can spend more time on what matters: helping you get home. In
          short, PropertyBuy shows up for our real estate agent partners so they
          can better show up for you.
